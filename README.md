# graduation-project

A portal for students as part of the Basics of Game Development class through which students will be able to post their game ideas in form of a Game Design Document, browse other students ideas, join project groups with each other, and implement their project ideas.

The portal will also allow students to post repositories of their finished projects for future students to use for inspiration.
